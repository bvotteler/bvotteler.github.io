The project was run in cooperation with Macquarie Bank and Goanna Education. I was approached by the Goanna to help continue the 6-month bootcamp after the initial lead instructor had to deal with health concerns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is an &lt;a href="https://itwire.com/strategy/ust-australia-works-with-indigenous-communities-to-close-gap-on-it-industry-participation-in-communities.html">article by iTWire&lt;/a> from around the time the project was announced/kicked off.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="teaching-java--microservices-spring-boot">Teaching Java &amp;amp; Microservices (Spring Boot)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I was asked to be the students&amp;rsquo; lead tutor for the second half of the program, teaching Java. First basics, then on to using Spring Boot to build microservices / micropages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a great experience to see these brand new developers find their feet, the struggles they went through, the perseverance they showed to finally chew through all the tough problems almost through sheer willpower alone.&lt;br>
Make no mistake, they had some really rough days, but were incredibly motivated to just carry on until they succeeded.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="key-takeaways-for-me">Key takeaways for me&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the key things I tried to instill and saw reinforced during the course of the program was that being successful as a developer has a lot to do with confidence in your ability to find answers to problems. Sure, you will find many on your own, but also, we must not be afraid to ask for help from our colleagues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of us tend to fight some level of imposter syndrome (see &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNBmHXS3A6I">Mike Cannon-Brookes&amp;rsquo; talk&lt;/a> about it), and asking for help can feel like you&amp;rsquo;re admitting defeat.&lt;br>
However, I strongly believe the opposite is true: It shows that you understand that your knowledge has limits, and that there is absolutely no shame in that. It makes you a more humble person willing to keep learning rather than stagnating where you are at.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, TL;DR: Whenever you struggle to find an answer to a software dev/engineering/architecture problem, do not hesitate to ask those around you for help. People will not think less of you.&lt;br>
And the odd ones who do&amp;hellip; well, they&amp;rsquo;ll think the same whether you ask or not. It&amp;rsquo;s not worth caring about their opinion as they&amp;rsquo;ll think the same thing about anyone who is not them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hugo Calendly Shortcode</title><link>https://bespokesy.dev/project/hugo-calendly-shortcode/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 09:50:04 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://bespokesy.dev/project/hugo-calendly-shortcode/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve built &lt;code>hugo-calendly-shortcode&lt;/code> to make it easier to add Calendly to your Hugo pages.&lt;br>
Simply &lt;strong>add a shortcode&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>pick a style&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>add your calendar/event name&lt;/strong>. That&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The basic, free &amp;amp; open-source version is available &lt;a href="https://github.com/bespokesy/hugo-calendly-shortcode">here&lt;/a>. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have built an advanced version, called &lt;strong>Hugo Calendly Shortcode Plus&lt;/strong>, which I &lt;a href="https://gum.co/hugo-calendly-shortcode-plus">offer on Gumroad&lt;/a> at a price far less than the time it would take a developer to build their own.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="who-is--isnt-this-for">Who is / isn&amp;rsquo;t this for?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Realistically, if you only want to embed one Calendly calendar/event on one page and don&amp;rsquo;t plan on touching it ever again, you&amp;rsquo;re most likely better off by simply adding the HTML/Javascript snippet directly into your page.&lt;br>
Seriously, Calendly makes it &lt;a href="https://help.calendly.com/hc/en-us/articles/223147027-Embed-options-overview">super easy&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, if you want to embed Calendly on various pages, maybe with different events and/or for different people, maybe even update those occasionally, then it becomes cumbersome to keep all those embeds aligned.&lt;br>
This is what I built the shortcode for; to make it somewhat easier to have consistent embeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, the shortcode is fairly easy to use: Just add a calendar name and you&amp;rsquo;re set. Maybe tweak the style if you do not want the default link popup and/or tweak the link text.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Head on over to the &lt;a href="https://docs.hcs.bespokesy.dev/overview/">demo and documentation site&lt;/a> I&amp;rsquo;ve created and take a look at &lt;a href="https://docs.hcs.bespokesy.dev/examples/">the examples&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="tell-me-about-hugo-calendly-shortcode-plus">Tell me about Hugo Calendly Shortcode Plus&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The advanced version offers more options to customize Calendly pages, adds ways to have default parameters shared between all pages and locations the shortcode is used. Plus, it takes advantage of Calendly Premium features such as adding UTM tracking parameters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have added a &lt;a href="https://docs.hcs.bespokesy.dev/overview/#features">full overview of the features, side-by-side&lt;/a> on the official docs for the shortcode.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
