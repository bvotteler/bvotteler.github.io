      <description>&lt;p&gt;This space will hold future projects. And I might share a few past projects, too.&lt;br&gt;
Regarding the latter, I&amp;rsquo;m in contact with former employers to find out if they can allow me to share information about interesting past projects. (And if so, how much I can safely share.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a lot of my past work was for my employers&#39; clients, this can be tricky. We need to take into account their respective agreements, too.&lt;br&gt;
I can&amp;rsquo;t make promises about what I will be able to share, but when I get permission, I&amp;rsquo;ll only share the ones that have enough &amp;ldquo;meat&amp;rdquo; after review to be valuable for my readers.&lt;/p&gt;
